# fortune
A web app clone of the old unix fortune program, written in Haskell and Elm
haskell-servant is used to create an api for fetching quotes, and Elm handles the front-end stuff.

# Background
I'm new to both Haskell and Elm, and this seemed like a good little project to start with.

# TODO
Add some styling & automate build process.

# Credits
I took the fortune file from http://silgro.com/fortunes.htm
